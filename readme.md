# Raspberry Pi Pico W Examples

A collection of example scripts and projects for the **Raspberry Pi Pico**, **Pico W**, and **Arduino Uno**, covering various sensors, modules, and functionalities. Each Pico and Pico W project/script is written in 4 different languages - Micropython, Circuitpython, C++ and Rust. Arduino projects and scripts are only available in C++.

## Features
- Example scripts for interfacing with **DHT11**, **MQ series gas sensors**, and more.
- **MicroPython** code for easy customization.
- Bluetooth & Wi-Fi connectivity examples.
- IoT integration and data logging.
